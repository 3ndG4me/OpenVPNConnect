# OpenVPNConnect
OpenVPNConnect is a WiFi Pineapple Module that allows you to connect to an openvpn server from the module interface

## WIP!!!

This is stable and freely available to use, but it is a WIP at the moment.
If this is approved by Hak5 you might see this is in your module manager in the near future ;).

# TODO:
1. Add a toggle giving VPN access to clients (currently the default setting)
2. Add the ability to upload .ovpn certs via the module interface
